# Problem Statement

The task is to create an administrative interface, including a dashboard, which will be used to display a set of requirements to an authenticated user.

Users should log into the dashboard using a username and password.

On the dashboard, it is expected to see widgets showing the amount of employees in the company, a list of birthdays for the month, etc. Use of initiative to complete the task is expected.
